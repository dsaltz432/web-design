		<h2>Dogs</h2>

		<p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is a canid that is known as man's best friend. The dog was the first domesticated animal[2][3] and has been widely kept as a working, hunting, and pet companion. In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.</p>
		<p>The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both of the domesticated and feral varieties. The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".[5] The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukkōn, represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-muscle").[6] The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.[7] The term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, reflecting the role of the dog as the earliest domesticated animal.</p>

		<h2>More about...</h2>
		<p>In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch[13] (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or puppies, from French poupée, until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valpa, Icelandic hvelpur).[14] The term "whelp" can also be used to refer to the young of any canid, or as a (somewhat archaic) alternative to "puppy".</p>
