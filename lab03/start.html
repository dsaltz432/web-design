			<h2> Description </h2>
			<p>
				Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating
			 	websites and web applications. It contains HTML and CSS-based
			 	design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and
				other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
				In June 2014 it was the No.1 project on GitHub with over 73,000 stars
			 	and more than 27,000 forks,[2] and a user base that includes MSNBC 
				and NASA

			<h2> Origin </h2>
			<p>
				Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter
 				as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before 
				Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which
				led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to Twitter
 				developer Mark Otto:

			<em>"A super small group of developers and I got together
			to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more.
			Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than
			another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap 
			as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the 
			company."</em>

			<h2> Features </h2>
			<p>
				Bootstrap is compatible with the latest versions of all major browsers.
				It gracefully degrades when used on older browsers such as Internet 
				Explorer 8. Since version 2.0 it also supports responsive web design.
				This means the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account 
				the characteristics of the device used (desktop, tablet, mobile phone).
				Starting with version 3.0, Bootstrap adopted a mobile first design philosophy,
				emphasizing responsive design by default. Bootstrap is open source and available
				on GitHub. Developers are encouraged to participate in the project and make 
				their own contributions to the platform. Recently, community members have 
				translated Bootstrap's documentation into various languages, including Chinese, 
				Spanish and Russian.

			<h2> Structure and function </h2>
			<p>
				Bootstrap is modular and consists essentially of a series of LESS stylesheets
				that implement the various components of the toolkit. A stylesheet called 
				bootstrap.less includes the components stylesheets. Developers can adapt the
				Bootstrap file itself, selecting the components they wish to use in their project.
				Adjustments are possible to a limited extent through a central configuration 
				stylesheet. More profound changes are possible by the LESS declarations. The 
				use of LESS stylesheet language allows the use of variables, functions and operators, 
				nested selectors, as well as so-called mixins. Since version 2.0, the configuration 
				of Bootstrap also has a special "Customize" option in the documentation. Moreover, 
				the developer chooses on a form the desired components and adjusts, if necessary, 
				the values of various options to their needs. The subsequently generated package 
				already includes the pre-built CSS style sheet. Grid system and responsive design 
				comes standard with a 1170 pixel wide, grid layout. Alternatively, the developer 
				can use a variable-width layout. For both cases, the toolkit has four variations to 
				make use of different resolutions and types of devices: mobile phones, portrait and 
				landscape, tablets and PCs with low and high resolution. Each variation adjusts the 
				width of the columns.
