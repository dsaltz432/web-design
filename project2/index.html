		<h2>Apple</h2>
		<article>
		Cook was asked to join Apple by Jobs in 1998. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs for the first time:
		</article>
		<aside>
		<em>Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998 I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius, and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company </em>
		</aside>
		<p>His first assignment was SVP for Worldwide Operations.[2] In relation to the role, Cook was quoted as saying: "You kind of want to manage it like you're in the dairy business. If it gets past its freshness date, you have a problem".[15] Cook closed factories and warehouses, replacing them with contract manufacturers, causing a reduction in the company's inventory, from months to days.</p>

		<h2>Leadership Style</h2>
		<p>As Apple Inc. CEO, Cook regularly begins sending emails at 4:30 a.m. and previously held Sunday-night staff meetings by telephone to prepare for the next week. Cook shared the keys to his leadership at Apple in May 2013: people, strategy, and execution; he explained, "If you get those three right the world is a great place." Under Cook's leadership, Apple has increased its donations to charity, and in 2013, he hired Lisa Jackson, formerly the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to assist Apple with the development of its renewable energy activities.</p>
		<h2>Personal Life</h2>
		<p>Cook is a fitness enthusiast and enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. Cook is known for being mostly solitary—he uses an off-campus fitness center for privacy—and very little is publicly known of his personal life: he explained in October 2014 that he has sought to achieve a "basic level of privacy". Cook was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996, an incident he said made him "see the world in a different way". He has since taken part in charity fundraising such as cycle races to raise money for the disease. Cook later told an Auburn alumni magazine that his symptoms came from "lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around".
		</p>
		<p>While delivering the 2010 commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook emphasized the importance of intuition during significant decision-making processes in his life, and further explained that preparation and hard work are also necessary to execute upon intuition.While it had been reported in early 2011 that Cook was gay, Cook chose to keep his personal life private. He did publicly support the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. In October 2014, the Alabama Academy of Honor inducted Cook, who spoke about his home state's record of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. The Academy of Honor is the highest honor Alabama gives its citizens
		</p>
		<p>On October 30, 2014, Cook came out as gay in an editorial for Bloomberg Businessweek, stating "I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me." Cook also explained that he has been open about his sexuality "for years" and, while many people at Apple were aware of his sexual orientation, he sought to focus on Apple's products and customers rather than his personal life. He ended the article by saying "We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick." As a result, Tim Cook also became the first openly gay CEO on the Fortune 500 list.
