				<h2> Early Life </h2>
					<p> Alan Emtage was born on November 27, 1964. "He attended high school at Harrison College from 1975 to 1983 (and in 1981 became the owner of a Sinclair ZX81 with 1K of memory), where he graduated at the top of his class, winning the Barbados Scholarship. 
					In 1983 Emtage entered McGill University in Montreal, Canada studying for an honors Bachelor's degree in computer science which was followed by a Master's degree in 1987 from which he graduated in 1991. Emtage was part of the team that brought the first Internet link to eastern Canada (and only the second link in the country) in 1986.  ("Alan Ermtage")

				<h2> Career </h2>
					
					<h3> Archie </h3>
						<p> In 1989 while a student and working as a systems administrator for the School of Computer Science, Alan conceived and implemented the original version of the Archie search engine, the world's first Internet search engine and the start of a line which leads directly to today's giants Yahoo and Google. (The name Archie stands for "archives" without the "v", not the kid from the comics)
						Working as a systems administrator, Alan was responsible for locating software for the students and staff of the faculty. The necessity for searching information became the mother of invention.
						He decided to develop a set of programs, that would go out and look through the repositories of software (public anonymous FTP sites) and build basically an index of the available software, a searchable database of filename. One thing led to another and word got out that he had an index available and people started writing in and asking if we could search the index on their behalf.
						As a result rather than having doing it himself, he allowed them to do it themselves so we wrote software that would allow them to come in and search the index themselves. That was the beginning.
						It seems that the administration of the university was the last to find out about what Alan had done. As Alan remembered: "We had no permission from the school to provide this service; and as a matter of fact, the head or our department found out about it for the first time by going to a conference. Somebody went up to him and said they really wanted to congratulate him for providing this service and he graciously smiled, said 'You're welcome' and went back to McGill and said 'what the hell is all of this? I have no idea what they're talking about'."
						"That was a once in a lifetime opportunity. It was largely being in the right place at the right time with the right idea. There were other people who had similar ideas and were working on similar projects, I just happened to get there first."
						Archie is considered the original search engine and a lot of the techniques that Emtage and other people that worked with him on Archie came up with are basically the same techniques that Google, Yahoo! and all the other search engines use.
						Later Alan and his colleagues developed various versions that allowed them to split up the service so that it would be available at other universities rather than taxing the facility at McGill.

					<h3> Building on Archie </h3>
						<p> In 1992, Emtage along with Peter J. Deutsch formed Bunyip Information Systems the world's first company expressly founded for and dedicated to providing Internet information services with a licensed commercial version of the Archie search engine.  Later, he became a member of the Internet Society, an international, non-profit organization founded in 1992 to provide leadership in Internet related standards, education, and policy.
						Emtage was a founding member of the Internet Society and went on to create and chair several working groups at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the standard-setting body for the Internet. Working with other pioneers such as Tim Berners-Lee, Marc Andreessen, Mark McCahill (creator of Gopher) and Jon Postel, Emtage co-chaired the Uniform Resource Identifier working group which created the standard for Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
