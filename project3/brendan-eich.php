	<h2>Brendan Eich</h2>

	<p>Brendan Eich is an American technologist and creator of the JavaScript programming language. He co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation, and served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical officer and briefly its chief executive officer.</p>

	<p>Brendan Eich received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University. He received his master's degree in 1985 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
	Eich started his career at Silicon Graphics, working for seven years on operating system and network code. He then worked for five years at MicroUnity Systems Engineering writing microkernel and DSP code, and doing the very first MIPS R4000 port of GCC.
	</p>

	<p> He started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. Having originally joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser", Eich was instead commissioned to create a new language that resembled Java, JavaScript for the Netscape Navigator Web browser. The first version was completed in ten days in order to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule, and was called Mocha, which was later renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and later JavaScript in the same month. Eich continued to oversee the development of SpiderMonkey, the specific implementation of JavaScript in Navigator, until 2011.</p>

	<p> In early 1998, he helped found the Mozilla project, with a website at mozilla.org, which was meant to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla's chief architect. AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL shut down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation.
	In August 2005, after serving as Lead Technologist and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Mozilla Foundation, Eich became CTO of the newly founded Mozilla Corporation, meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit arm.
	</p>

	<p> On March 24, 2014, Eich was promoted to CEO of Mozilla Corporation. His appointment sparked controversy over a $1,000 political donation Eich had made in 2008 to the successful campaign for California Proposition 8, which sought to establish that, "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California."  This had been noted publicly two years prior, in March 2012, and was criticized at the time in social media by gay rights activists, particularly on Twitter. After his appointment to CEO, the controversy reemerged. In the ensuing public debate, OKCupid and two gay application developers called for a boycott of the company. A number of Mozilla Foundation employees asked him to step down, while others at the Mozilla Corporation spoke out on their blogs in his favor. Three of Mozilla Corporation's six directors resigned just prior to Eich's appointment, which the Mozilla Foundation attributed to "a variety of reasons. Two of the board members had been planning to leave for some time, one since January and one explicitly at the end of the CEO search, regardless of the person selected. “On April 3, 2014, Eich stepped down as CEO and resigned from working at Mozilla. In his personal blog, Eich posted that "under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader." Following Eich's resignation, the National Organization for Marriage called for its own boycott of Mozilla, due to his resigning instead of explaining his own view. </p>

	<p> Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities, JavaScript and Java are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the semantics and design are influenced by the self and Scheme programming languages.
	JavaScript is also used in environments that aren't web-based, such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web applications. On the client side, JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform just-in-time compilation.

	JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich, while working for Netscape Communications Corporation. While competing with Microsoft for user adoption of web technologies and platforms, Netscape considered their client-server offering a distributed OS with a portable version of Sun Microsystems' Java providing an environment in which applets could be run. Because Java was a competitor of C++ and aimed at professional programmers, Netscape also wanted a lightweight interpreted language that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers, like Microsoft's Visual Basic (see JavaScript and Java).
	Although it was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript when it was deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3. </p>

	<p> 
		The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in its Netscape Navigator web browser. The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new web programming language.
	There is a common misconception that the JavaScript language was influenced by C-- (pronounced "See-minus-minus"), an earlier web page scripting language developed by Nombas. Brendan Eich, however, had never heard of C-- before he created LiveScript. Nombas did pitch their embedded web page scripting to Netscape, though web page scripting was not a new concept, as shown by ViolaWWW. Nombas later switched to offering JavaScript instead of C-- in their ScriptEase product and was part of the TC39 group that standardized ECMAScript.

	</p> 

	<p> JavaScript quickly gained widespread adoption as a client-side scripting language for web pages. Microsoft introduced JavaScript support in its own web browser, Internet Explorer, in version 3.0, released in August 1996.Microsoft's webserver, Internet Information Server, introduced support for server-side scripting in JavaScript with the release of version 3.0, also in 1996. Microsoft started to promote webpage scripting using the umbrella term Dynamic HTML.
	Microsoft's JavaScript implementation was later renamed JScript to avoid trademark issues. JScript added new date methods to fix the Y2K-problematic methods in JavaScript, which were based on Java's java.util.Date class.

	In November 1996, Netscape announced that it had submitted JavaScript to Ecma International for consideration as an industry standard, and subsequent work resulted in the standardized version named ECMAScript. In June 1997, Ecma International published the first edition of the ECMA-262 specification. In June 1998, some modifications were made to adapt it to the ISO/IEC-16262 standard, and the second edition was released. The third edition of ECMA-262 was published on December 1999.
	Development of the fourth edition of the ECMAScript standard was never completed. The fifth edition was released in December 2009. The current edition of the ECMAScript standard is 5.1, released in June 2011.
